## NASA HACKATHON 07/10/2023 Valencia

We developed a solution for the challenge of `Planetary Tourism Office`
We developed a website to show our services, an interactive moon, and an interactive presentation to present our idea.
Additionally we gave out flyers, and gave a 5 min presentation of the proyect developed.

Keep in mind this was in less than 48h!
